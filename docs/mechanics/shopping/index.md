# Shopping System

## Why

A shopping system allows players to obtain resources and items that cannot be obtained through crafting or gathering, giving players a sense of progression and access to unique items.

## Goals

- Allow players to purchase items using a currency system
- Provide a variety of items to choose from, including rare and unique items
- Create a sense of progression and reward for players

## High-Level Summary

The shopping system allows players to purchase items from a vendor NPC using gold coins as currency. The vendor NPC will offer a rotating selection of items, including common, rare, and unique items. Players can sell items in their inventory to the vendor in exchange for gold coins.

## Mechanics

### Vendor NPC

The vendor NPC will spawn randomly in different locations on the map and will offer a rotating selection of items to purchase. The vendor will have a limited amount of gold coins that can be spent by the player, which will refresh periodically.

### Currency

The currency in the shopping system is gold coins, which can be obtained by completing quests, selling items to the vendor NPC, or found in chests or other lootable objects.

### Inventory Management

Players can access their inventory at any time during gameplay and can compare and swap items as desired. When a player purchases an item from the vendor, it will be automatically added to their inventory.

## Example

The player comes across a vendor NPC in a town and sees that they are offering a rare sword for 1000 gold coins. The player decides to sell some excess items from their inventory to the vendor to obtain the necessary coins. Once they have enough coins, they purchase the sword and it is added to their inventory.
