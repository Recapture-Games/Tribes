# Building System

The building system in the game allows players to construct various structures, such as walls, towers, and production buildings. These structures require different resources to build, and some require certain resource combinations to unlock.

## Resource Requirements

### Basic Resources

The basic resources used in building are wood, stone, and metal. Each resource has different characteristics that affect the durability, strength, and cost of the structure.

- **Wood** is a common resource that is easy to gather and cheap to build with. However, it is relatively weak compared to stone and metal.
- **Stone** is a strong and durable resource that is more expensive and difficult to gather than wood.
- **Metal** is the strongest and most durable resource, but it is also the most expensive and difficult to gather.

### Resource Combinations

Some structures require specific resource combinations to unlock. Here are a few examples:

- **Reinforced Wall**: This wall requires stone and metal to build. It has a higher durability and defensive value than a basic wooden wall.
- **Windmill**: This production building requires wood and metal to build. It produces flour from gathered wheat.
- **Armory**: This production building requires stone and metal to build. It allows players to craft advanced weapons and armor.

## Keybinds

The player controller for building uses the following keybinds:

- **Left Mouse Button**: Places the selected structure at the cursor location.
- **Right Mouse Button**: Cancels the current structure placement.
- **1-9 Number Keys**: Selects the corresponding structure from the player's inventory.
- **Q**: Rotates the selected structure counterclockwise.
- **E**: Rotates the selected structure clockwise.
- **Tab**: Toggles between the building and combat mode.

## Conclusion

The building system in the game provides players with a way to create structures that can enhance their base, production, and defensive capabilities. By using different resource combinations, players can unlock advanced structures that are more durable, efficient, and effective than basic wooden structures.
