# Win Condition

The goal of Island Troll Tribes is to be the last team standing at the end of the round. There are two ways to achieve this:

1. Eliminate all other teams - Teams can engage in direct combat with other teams and eliminate them. The last team remaining wins the round.

2. Gather the most resources - Teams can also focus on gathering resources and constructing buildings to establish a strong base. At the end of the round, the team with the most resources (wood, stone, and gold) will be declared the winner.

In either case, players must work together and strategize to ensure their team's victory. Communication and teamwork are key to success in Island Troll Tribes.
