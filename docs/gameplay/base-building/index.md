# Base Building

## Why
Base building is a crucial aspect of the game, as it allows players to establish a foothold on the island, protect themselves from enemies, and gather resources more efficiently.

## Goals
- Allow players to construct buildings to aid in resource gathering and defense
- Create a system that rewards strategic base placement and planning
- Provide players with a variety of building options to customize their base

## High Level Summary
Players can construct a variety of buildings to aid in resource gathering and defense. Each building has a specific function, and requires certain resources to construct. Players must strategically place their buildings to protect against enemy attacks and optimize resource collection.

### Building Types
1. Resource Gathering Buildings
   - Farms: Produce food to sustain your team.
   - Lumber Mills: Produce lumber for building and unit upgrades.
   - Mines: Produce gold for purchasing items and upgrades.
2. Defensive Buildings
   - Barracks: Trains defensive units to defend the base.
   - Watchtower: Provides vision of a large area around the base.
   - Walls: Block enemy movement and provide cover for defensive units.
3. Upgrade Buildings
   - Blacksmith: Allows players to upgrade their units and buildings.
   - Mage Tower: Allows players to research new spells and abilities.

## Example
A team of players decides to construct a base on the western side of the island. They start by building a lumber mill and a mine to gather resources. They also build a barracks and train some defensive units to protect their base. They strategically place walls and a watchtower to provide additional defense against enemy attacks. Finally, they construct a blacksmith to upgrade their units and buildings and a mage tower to research new abilities. With their base fully established, the team is now ready to venture out and engage with other teams on the island.
