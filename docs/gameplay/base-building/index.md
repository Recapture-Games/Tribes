## Example

A team of players decides to construct a base on the western side of the island. They start by building a lumber mill and a mine to gather resources. They also build a barracks and train some defensive units to protect their base. They strategically place walls and a watchtower to provide additional defense against enemy attacks. Finally, they construct a blacksmith to upgrade their units and buildings and a mage tower to research new abilities. With their base fully established, the team is now ready to venture out and engage with other teams on the island.
