# Game Overview

Island Troll Tribes is a team-based multiplayer game that takes inspiration from the Warcraft 3 mod of the same name. Players work together in teams of 3-4 to gather resources, build up a base, and prepare for combat against other teams. The last team standing wins the round.

The game is played from a first-person perspective and features four playable classes: Hunter, Spy, Witch Doctor, and Gatherer. Each class has unique abilities and playstyles that encourage teamwork and strategic planning.

Resource gathering and base building are critical elements of the game. Players must collect wood, stone, and gold to construct buildings and defensive traps to protect their base. Defensive traps, such as spike pits and bear traps, can be strategically placed to slow down enemy teams or deal damage.

Combat is also a major focus of the game. Players can choose to engage in direct combat against enemy teams or sneak into their base to steal resources. The Witch Doctor class has access to powerful curses that can weaken or incapacitate enemy players.

Island Troll Tribes is a game that encourages teamwork, strategy, and creativity. With a variety of classes and gameplay mechanics, every round is different and offers a unique experience.
