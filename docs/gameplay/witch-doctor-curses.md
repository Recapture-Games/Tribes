# Witch Doctor Curses

## Why
Curses add a new level of strategy to the game, allowing players to debuff enemies and gain an advantage in combat.

## Goals
- Increase the depth of gameplay by adding a new mechanic.
- Allow for more dynamic combat encounters.
- Create more variety in the playable classes.

## High Level Summary
Witch Doctors are able to cast curses on enemy players to weaken them in combat. Each curse has a different effect, and they can be used tactically to gain the upper hand in fights. 

### Curse Types
1. **Mark of the Hunted**: The cursed player takes increased damage from all sources.
2. **Curse of Weakness**: The cursed player deals reduced damage with all attacks.
3. **Curse of the Silent**: The cursed player cannot use any abilities for a short time.
4. **Hex**: The cursed player is transformed into a harmless creature for a short time.

### Implementation
- Create new curse abilities for the Witch Doctor class.
- Design visual effects for each curse.
- Add logic to apply the curse effect to targeted players.

## Example
A Witch Doctor is ambushed by a group of enemy players while gathering resources. They quickly cast Curse of Weakness on the leader of the group, reducing their damage output. The Witch Doctor's team swoops in and easily dispatches the weakened enemy, gaining valuable resources and items.
