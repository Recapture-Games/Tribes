## Elevator Pitch

In our game, players find themselves stranded on a mysterious island with limited resources and must work together to survive against the elements and dangerous creatures / players. With a focus on exploration, crafting, and building, players can gather resources, construct shelter, and band together in an attempt to be the last team standing. Survival isn't easy, as players must also fend off attacks from ferocious animals, players, and contend with limited supplies. With a focus on short rounds, procedural islands, and pvp content, our game is the ultimate survival experience that will keep players engaged for hours on end.

**Design Pillars:**

+ **Teamwork and Coordination:** The game is designed to promote teamwork and coordination among players. Each class has unique abilities and playstyles that complement each other, and players must work together to gather resources, construct their base, and engage in combat with enemy teams.

+ **Resource Gathering and Base Building:** The game places a heavy emphasis on resource gathering and base building mechanics. Players must gather resources to construct and upgrade their base, and must defend their base against enemy attacks.

+ **Strategic Decision-Making:** The game is designed to promote strategic decision-making and risk assessment. Players must decide when to gather resources, when to construct new buildings, when to engage in combat, and when to retreat.
