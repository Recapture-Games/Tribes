# Inventory System

## Why

The inventory system is a crucial aspect of any RPG game as it allows players to manage and organize their items. The inventory system in Diablo 2 is a great example of a well-designed inventory system that provides players with a lot of flexibility and options.

## Goals

- Allow players to carry and manage their items effectively
- Provide players with a variety of item types and rarities
- Allow players to trade and sell items with other players

## High-Level Summary

The inventory system in our game will be based off of the inventory system in Diablo 2. Players will have a limited number of slots in their inventory to carry their items, and they will need to manage their inventory effectively in order to carry all of the items that they need. Items will be organized into different categories, such as weapons, armor, potions, and gold. Players will be able to trade and sell items with other NPCs in order to obtain items that they need.

## Features

### Inventory Slots

Players will start with a limited number of slots in their inventory and will need to manage their inventory effectively in order to carry all of the items that they need. Players will be able to increase their inventory slots by purchasing bags from vendors or by completing quests.

### Item Types

Items will be organized into different categories, such as weapons, armor, potions, and gold. Each item type will have its own icon and will be color-coded based on its rarity.

### Item Rarity

Items will have different levels of rarity, ranging from common to rare to legendary. Players will need to collect and manage items of different rarities in order to progress through the game.

### Item Trading

Players will be able to trade and sell items with certain NPCs in order to obtain items that they need. The trading system will be designed to encourage exploration and progression.

## Example

The player opens their inventory and sees that they are running out of space. They decide to sell some of their excess potions to a vendor in order to make room for more valuable items. They then trade some of their items with the shopkeeper NPC in order to obtain a rare piece of armor that they need.
