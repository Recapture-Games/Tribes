# Win Condition

The goal of **Tribes** is to be the last team standing at the end of the round. There are two ways to achieve this:

1. Eliminate all other teams - Teams can engage in direct combat with other teams and eliminate them. The last team remaining wins the round.

2. Eliminate the end game boss - Teams will have the option to beat a boss in order to win the game. Once the boss is defeated, the player or team will receive a unique buff that allows them to see other players on the map regardless of distance. This buff is designed to prevent rounds from lasting indefinitely and give players an incentive to actively seek out and engage with other players in PvP combat. The boss should be killable within a reasonable amount of time, players can aim to take on this boss anywhere from 25-45 minutes into a round

In either case, players must work together and strategize to ensure their team's victory. Communication and teamwork are key to success in Island Troll Tribes.
