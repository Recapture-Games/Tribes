# Functional Breakdown: Hunter

## Overview

The Hunter class is a ranged damage dealer that specializes in hunting animals for resources.

## Abilities

1. **Basic Attack - Bow and Arrow:** Fires a single arrow at the target.

2. **Multi-shot:** Fires multiple arrows in a cone in front of the Hunter, damaging all targets hit.

3. **Trap:** Places a trap on the ground that, when triggered, deals damage to and immobilizes the target.

4. **Eagle Eye:** Enhances the Hunter's vision, allowing them to see enemies from further away.

## Playstyle

The Hunter excels at ranged combat, and is particularly effective against animals. The Multi-shot ability allows the Hunter to quickly clear out groups of enemies, while the Trap ability can be used to immobilize and damage dangerous foes. The Eagle Eye ability gives the Hunter an advantage in scouting out enemies and avoiding danger.

## Resource Gathering

The Hunter is able to gather resources from animals by killing them with their bow and arrow. Animals may drop meat, leather, and bone, which can be used for crafting or traded with other players.

## Weaknesses

The Hunter is vulnerable in close combat, as they do not have any abilities that allow them to fight effectively at close range. Additionally, the Hunter's abilities have relatively long cooldowns, so they must be used strategically.

## Recommended Team Role

The Hunter is best suited as a damage dealer, providing ranged support to a team. They can also gather resources for the team by hunting animals.
