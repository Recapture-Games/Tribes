# Traps

**Why:**
Traps add a layer of strategy and depth to gameplay by allowing players to defend their base and ambush enemy players.

**Goals:**

- Enhance the strategic depth of the game by providing a variety of defensive options to players.
- Add tension to the gameplay as players need to be mindful of traps when exploring enemy bases.
- Encourage teamwork and coordination among players by allowing them to set up complex trap networks.

**High Level Summary:**

Traps are structures that players can build to defend their base and ambush enemy players. There will be a variety of traps available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Traps can be used to slow down enemy players, deal damage, or even capture them.

**Example:**

A player sets up a trap network at the entrance to their base, consisting of spike traps and a net trap. The spike traps will damage and slow down enemy players, while the net trap will capture them, making them easy targets for the defending team. As the enemy team approaches, they trigger the spike traps, allowing the defending team to easily pick them off.
