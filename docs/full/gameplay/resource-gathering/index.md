# Resource Gathering

## Why

Resource gathering is an essential part of the game as players need to collect resources in order to build their base, defenses and gear up for combat.

## Goals

- Resources should be scarce and players should have to travel some distance to obtain them.
- Gathering should be a significant portion of the game, but players should not spend the entire round gathering resources.
- Gathering should be dangerous and players should have to be on the lookout for enemies.

## High Level Summary

Resources will be scattered throughout the game world, and players will have to gather them to build up their base, gear up, and prepare for combat. There will be a variety of different resources to gather, including lumber, stone, gold, and food. Each resource will require a specific tool to gather, and some resources will require a specific class to gather. For example, the Gatherer class will be the only class that can gather food.

Once players have gathered resources, they will need to bring them back to their base to use them. Resources will be stored in different types of buildings, such as lumber mills for lumber and mines for gold.

## Example

The Hunter and Gatherer classes are out gathering resources. 
The Hunter is gathering lumber with his axe, while the Gatherer is picking berries for food. 
They hear some rustling in the bushes nearby and see an enemy team approaching. 
The Hunter quickly puts down a trap to slow them down while the Gatherer grabs what resources she can and they both make a run for it back to their base.
