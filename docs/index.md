**Design Pillars:**
- Teamwork and Coordination: The game is designed to promote teamwork and coordination among players. Each class has unique abilities and playstyles that complement each other, and players must work together to gather resources, construct their base, and engage in combat with enemy teams.

- Resource Gathering and Base Building: The game places a heavy emphasis on resource gathering and base building mechanics. Players must gather resources to construct and upgrade their base, and must defend their base against enemy attacks.

- Strategic Decision-Making: The game is designed to promote strategic decision-making and risk assessment. Players must decide when to gather resources, when to construct new buildings, when to engage in combat, and when to retreat. The game rewards players who are able to make sound decisions and adapt to changing circumstances.
