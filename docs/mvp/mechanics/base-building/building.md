# Base Building

The MVP feature for base building will allow players to construct basic structures, such as walls and simple shelters, to protect themselves and their resources from danger. Examples of MVP buildings could include:

- Walls: Players can build walls around their base to keep out hostile creatures and other players. Walls can be constructed from basic materials, such as wood or stone.

- Campfire: Players can construct a campfire to cook food, keep warm, and regenerate health over time. Campfires require fuel to stay lit, such as wood or coal.

- Tent: Players can construct a simple tent to rest and regenerate stats, such as health and hunger. Tents can be crafted from basic materials, such as cloth and sticks.
