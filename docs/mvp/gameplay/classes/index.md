# MVP Player Controller

## Why

The player controller is the core component of the game, providing the player with the ability to navigate and interact with the game world.

## Goals

- Provide intuitive controls that are easy to learn
- Allow players to move, jump, and interact with objects in the game world
- Ensure that the player controller is flexible enough to accommodate different classes

## High-Level Summary

The player controller will be the same for both the Hunter and Gatherer classes in the MVP. Players will use the following controls:

- Movement: Players will use the WASD keys to move their character around the game world.
- Jumping: Players will use the spacebar to jump.
- Interaction: Players will use the left mouse button to interact with objects in the game world, such as picking up resources or opening doors.

## Example

The player begins the game as a Gatherer. They use the WASD keys to move their character to a nearby tree and begin chopping it down using their primary tool. After gathering the resources, they move to a nearby copper vein and begin mining. They use the left mouse button to swing their pickaxe and gather some resources. Once they have gathered enough resources, they move to a nearby crafting station and create a few crude walls that can help protect their base.
